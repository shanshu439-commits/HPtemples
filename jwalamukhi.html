<h2>About Temple</h2>
<p>
Jwala Ji Temple is famous for its eternal flame (Akhand Jyoti)
which burns naturally from rock fissures.
According to Hindu mythology, when Goddess Sati sacrificed herself during her father Daksha’s yajna, Lord Shiva carried her burning body in grief. To stop his cosmic dance of destruction, 
Lord Vishnu cut her body into pieces with his Sudarshan Chakra.
It is believed that Sati’s tongue fell at this sacred spot, which is why flames emerge naturally from the earth here.
These flames symbolize the divine energy of the goddess and are worshipped as manifestations of Shakti.
It is one of the most sacred Shakti Peethas.
