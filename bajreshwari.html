<h2>About Temple</h2>
<p>
Bajreshwari Devi Temple is one of the 51 Shakti Peethas located in Kangra.
It is dedicated to Goddess Vajreshwari, a form of Durga.
The legend of Shakti Peethas is deeply rooted in Hindu mythology. 
After Goddess Sati immolated herself in protest against her father’s disrespect to Shiva, a grief-stricken Shiva carried her body and performed the cosmic Tandava (dance of destruction). 
To pacify him and save the universe, Vishnu used his Sudarshana Chakra to dismember her body into 51 pieces. 
Each site where a part fell became a sacred abode of the Divine Feminine or Shakti.
The spot at Nagarkot (ancient Kangra) where Sati’s left breast landed became what is now known as Bajreshwari Peetha.
