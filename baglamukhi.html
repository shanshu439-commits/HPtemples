<h2>About Temple</h2>
<p>
Baglamukhi Temple is dedicated to Goddess Baglamukhi,
one of the ten Mahavidyas in Hinduism.
<br>The Origin of Goddess Baglamukhi.</br>

According to Hindu scriptures, once a massive storm threatened to destroy the universe. 
The gods prayed to the Divine Mother for help. 
From the sacred waters of Haridra Sarovar (a mystical pond associated with turmeric),
Goddess Baglamukhi emerged in a golden-yellow form and stopped the destructive forces.
She is often depicted holding the tongue of a demon while striking him with a mace. 
This symbolizes her power to paralyze evil speech and negative forces.
 Her name comes from:
“Bagla” meaning to rein in or control.
“Mukhi” meaning face or speech.
