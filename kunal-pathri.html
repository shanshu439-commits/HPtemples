<h2>About Temple</h2>
<p>
Kunal Pathri Temple is dedicated to Goddess Kapaleshwari.
It is located in the scenic hills near Dharamshala.
Surrounded by lush greenery and the majestic Dhauladhar mountain range, this temple is dedicated to Goddess Kapaleshwari (a form of Goddess Durga).
The name “Kunal Pathri” is derived from two words:
Kunal – meaning eye.
Pathri – meaning stone.
It is believed that the eyes of Goddess Sati fell at this sacred site, making it one of the important spiritual places in the Shakti tradition of Himachal Pradesh.
